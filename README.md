# Design 

## Design choices

The site will be visited by people who are looking for products made of natural ingredients which could help with their health or skin problems. Therefore, the design elements evoke the feeling of nature and purity as well as solution to their problems. 


## Color Scheme 

The main colors of the website are different shades of green and white. Ash grey green is used for card-outline and to make certain containers stand out. Dartmouth green is used for header, footer and buttons. Pakistan green is used for the banner in order to make it stand out. 

![Color Scheme](./docs/color_scheme.JPG)

## Typography 

Google Fonts website was used to import the fonts chosen for this website. Lato was used as a general font for the website. Handlee was used for headers and for the quote. San seriff was added in case browser doesn't support the other two fonts. 

![Font Handlee](./docs/handlee.JPG)
![Font Lato](./docs/lato.JPG)
